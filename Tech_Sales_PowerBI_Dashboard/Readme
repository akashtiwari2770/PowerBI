📊 Tech Company Sales Dashboard | Power BI
In this project, I designed and developed a dynamic sales dashboard for a tech company, providing a comprehensive view of sales performance across various dimensions. The dashboard enables stakeholders to track key metrics and make data-driven decisions effortlessly.

🔍 Key Insights:
Top Performing Products: Identified best-selling products to spotlight high-demand items.
Sales by Region: Analyzed regional sales trends to understand market performance and growth opportunities.
Total Revenue: Visualized overall revenue, offering a clear snapshot of the company’s financial health.
⚙️ Power BI Features Used:
DAX Formulas: Created custom measures to calculate sales growth, average revenue per product, and other performance metrics.
Slicers: Enabled intuitive filtering for quick insights by product, region, and time period.
Pie Chart for Brand Percentage: Illustrated each brand’s contribution to total sales, making brand performance comparisons easy.
This project honed my skills in data modeling, dashboard design, and creating user-friendly visual analytics with Power BI. It’s a valuable tool for tracking performance, identifying trends, and supporting strategic decisions.
